Many people are not aware, but facebook was a major driver behind the 500k+ senior engineering pay.\n\n                Released major open source software: PyTorch, React, GraphQL, React Native. They basically invented modern web development.\n\n                Facebook is basically the only game in town when it comes to open source. Whatsmore, Mark Zuckerberg should be more widely applauded. I know his open source ai strategy has capitalist roots, but its still great for the world.",

      "comment": " really do not like Google as a company, but this is one of those cases where I agree with them. It was always clear that websites could track you in incognito mode. Somehow people thinking that Google is not a website that can do that does not make it Google's fault. You still have to accept Google's cookie banner when opening the site in incognito, giving another indication they track you."

In fact, I believe most people still don't understand (b)."
