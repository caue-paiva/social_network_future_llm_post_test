         "While the intention behind UBI is admirable, it could disincentivize work and burden the economy. There needs to be a balance between providing security and encouraging productivity. Plus, funding UBI might require high taxes that could stifle economic growth and innovation.",
         "The concept of UBI is idealistic and doesn't take into account human nature. People value work and purpose. There's a risk that UBI could lead to a decline in the labor force participation rate, which is essential for a robust economy and for funding the very social programs we value.",
         "Implementing UBI could actually fuel inflation, as the increase in disposable income would likely lead to higher demand for goods and services. This could raise prices, negating the very benefits UBI is supposed to provide and harming the economy in the long run."

Many people are not aware, but facebook was a major driver behind the 500k+ senior engineering pay.\n\n                Released major open source software: PyTorch, React, GraphQL, React Native. They basically invented modern web development.\n\n                Facebook is basically the only game in town when it comes to open source. Whatsmore, Mark Zuckerberg should be more widely applauded. I know his open source ai strategy has capitalist roots, but its still great for the world.",

         " really do not like Google as a company, but this is one of those cases where I agree with them. It was always clear that websites could track you in incognito mode. Somehow people thinking that Google is not a website that can do that does not make it Google's fault. You still have to accept Google's cookie banner when opening the site in incognito, giving another indication they track you.",
         "I thought it was well understood that \"private\" mode in browsers relates to what your local machine records about where you visit.\n                    I didn't even think that a web site could know you were in that mode, let alone honour it.",
         "Incognito mode is supposed to not send your regular cookies so sites shouldn't be able to track you unless they use dubious stealthy tricks rather than the explicit well-known and documented method (i.e. a cookie). While I know that it's possible, I think it's morally despicable and I expect better from established (and ostensibly honorable) companies like Google.\n            The fact that they now basically say \"cookies or not, we're gonna track you anyway\" sounds to me like another step in the downfall of Google\n            "
