explanation: I agree with the post that Universal Basic Income is essential for addressing inequality and job displacement caused by automation. As a musician and composer, I understand the challenges of making a living in the arts industry, and UBI could provide financial security for artists. However, the reply raises a valid concern about the potential inflationary effects of UBI. While I believe UBI is still necessary, it's important to consider and address the potential negative consequences.

 Currently on post: I love facebook. I hate other big tech companies. Facebook has done far more for software than any other company in the last 15 years. They:

                Pushed salaries up across the board. Many people are not aware, but facebook was a major driver behind the 500k+ senior engineering pay.

                Released major open source software: PyTorch, React, GraphQL, React Native. They basically invented modern web development.

                Facebook is basically the only game in town when it comes to open source. Whatsmore, Mark Zuckerberg should be more widely applauded. I know his open source ai strategy has capitalist roots, but its still great for the world.

reply: I think it's fine to applaud their pro open source behavior, while still being critical of the ill they've released upon society. Cambridge Analytica and spreading mob violence in some countries come to mind.

reply:  really do not like Google as a company, but this is one of those cases where I agree with them. It was always clear that websites could track you in incognito mode. Somehow people thinking that Google is not a website that can do that does not make it Google's fault. You still have to accept Google's cookie banner when opening the site in incognito, giving another indication they track you.

            Incognito mode is supposed to not send your regular cookies so sites shouldn't be able to track you unless they use dubious stealthy tricks rather than the explicit well-known and documented method (i.e. a cookie). While I know that it's possible, I think it's morally despicable and I expect better from established (and ostensibly honorable) companies like Google.

The reply provides additional context, stating that incognito mode is supposed to prevent tracking by not sending regular cookies. However, the reply also expresses disappointment in Google's actions. As a tech start-up founder interested in privacy and technology, I believe this is an important issue. I will upvote the post to show support for raising awareness about privacy concerns.

post:  Google Is Tracking You Even in Incognito Mode, New Disclaimer Is Up

                    I thought it was well understood that "private" mode in browsers relates to what your local machine records about where you visit.
                    I didn't even think that a web site could know you were in that mode, let alone honour it
                

reply: 
            Incognito mode is supposed to not send your regular cookies so sites shouldn't be able to track you unless they use dubious stealthy tricks rather than the explicit well-known and documented method (i.e. a cookie). While I know that it's possible, I think it's morally despicable and I expect better from established (and ostensibly honorable) companies like Google.
            The fact that they now basically say "cookies or not, we're gonna track you anyway" sounds to me like another step in the downfall of Google
